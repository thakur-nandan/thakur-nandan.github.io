<p style="font-size: 15px;">Worked as TA for the CS 479/679 undergraduate and graduate level mixed course on Introduction to Artificial Intelligence in University of Waterloo. Addressed students' doubts and wrote and evaluated a whole assignment by myself. In this assignment, I asked students to code basic foundational principles in neural networks, including the model forward pass, backpropogation algorithm from scratch (using numpy only) and multiple different loss functions. I also set a regression and classification problem for the students to evaluate. All the codes were written in Python.</p>
