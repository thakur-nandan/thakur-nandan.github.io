## Mentorship

I've been blessed with the oppertunity to mentor few passionate undergraduate, masters and informally helped out early PhD students with projects during my time at University of Waterloo. Here's a brief list of students:

### 1-on-1 mentorship

#### Winter 2025

- Worked with Crystina Zhang (co-mentor) to mentor <i>Forrest Gao</i> (ECE Masters, UWaterloo) on reproducing scores on MIRACL for multilingual retrieval models such as KALM, DRAMA and extending SWIM-X, a synthetic LLM-generated multilingual retrieval training dataset. I designed the scope of the project, provided relevant background, fixed day-to-day bugs faced in Compute Canada, provided starter code base, and conducted code reviews

- Mentored <i>Jonathan Zhao</i> (CS Undergraduate, UWaterloo) on constructing complex queries for training retrieval models. The idea was to use an LLM recursively to continue to edit and rephrase the question in multiple stages. Similar to Forrest, I designed the scope of the project, provided relevant background, fixed day-to-day bugs faced in Compute Canada, provided starter code base, and conducted code reviews.


## A brief history about my journey:

I transitioned into an academic lifestyle to pursue my curiosity in conducting research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR). My career path has evolved across several domains — from electronics → data analytics → data science → NLP & IR.

I strongly believe in open-source research as a means to enhance education and help others (and myself) develop the ability to critically ask the most impactful questions in research. I owe immense gratitude to my academic mentors and peers (everyone at UKP Lab & UWaterloo), whose early guidance was instrumental in helping me navigate this interdisciplinary shift.

Continuing this tradition of mentorship and community engagement, I’m eager to give back by mentoring a few early-stage undergraduate or master’s students at the University of Waterloo who are interested in my research directions consisting of data, evaluations in information retrieval & RAG. Personally, I encourage students with diverse backgrounds or in a similar nutshell as mine to reach out.
