<p style="font-size: 15px;">A brief history about my story, I pivoted into an academic lifesyle to pursure my curiousity to conduct research in NLP and IR. 
I shifted domains, starting from electronics -> data analytics -> data science -> NLP & IR. I truly believe in open-source to help educate others better (including myself) on how to critically access information better from the vast pool of information available in the Internet. Credit must be given to all my academic mentors and peers' guidance, which have been influential at an early stage in my career to help overcome this challenge.</p>

<p style="font-size: 15px;">I would like to continue the tradition and give back to the community, I am willing to mentor a few early stage undergraduate / master students in University of Waterloo interested towards my direction in embedding models and information retrieval. Personally, I encourage students with diverse backgrounds or in a similar nutshell as mine to reach out.</p>

<p style="font-size: 15px;">If you are interested, Send out an introductory email to me about yourself, introduce me with your academic background, preferably attach your CV and send me on my personal email: nandan.thakur@uwaterloo.ca.</p>
